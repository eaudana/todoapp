# React To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. The application allows users to add, delete, and filter tasks, as well as update the status of each task.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
- **Update Task Status**: Users can change the status of each task to "In Progress" or "Completed" using a dropdown menu.
- **Search Tasks**: Users can search for specific tasks using the search bar. The list of tasks will be filtered in real-time based on the search query.
- **Visual Status Indicators**: The background color of the status dropdown changes based on the selected status (yellow for "In Progress" and green for "Completed").
